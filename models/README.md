Place your model and scaler here, for example:

- `models/best_model.pkl` - your trained model saved with joblib
- `models/scaler_model.pkl` - your fitted scaler saved with joblib

If you prefer to keep models outside the repository, update `app.py`'s `MODEL_PATHS` and `SCALER_PATHS` to point to your preferred location.
